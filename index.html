            <p>
            Hello there, my name is Terrence Chung and I'm another aspiring Founders and Coders member. 
            I studied chemistry at university and I'm currently working at a clinical trials company as part of the computer systems validation team.
            </p>
            <p>
            Outside of work, I’m a huge foodie and I enjoy going to kpop dance classes which is a great way to exercise and to meet new people. 
            Luckily, there is a huge community in London! 
            I've also always been quite into tinkering with computers and smartphones but until recently, 
            programming has always been something that I've been no afraid to delve into.

        <h1 class="section-header">Why coding</h1>
        <div class="section-paragraph">
            <p>
            Coding is and will continue to be a huge factor in all our daily lives as 
            virtually everything we do is related to tech in some shape or form. I believe that it will be able
             to give me the opportunity to contribute to projects that can bring a positive impact people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Learning to code has made me feel like both the smartest and the dumbest person in the world 
             all in the span of a few minutes. It's been a constant back and forth between feeling frustrated
            when you are stuck and feeling immense satisfaction when you stick with a problem and eventually solve it.
            </p>
        </div>

    <!-- Why FAC section -->
    <section id="why-fac">
        <h1 class="section-header">Why Founders and Coders?</h1>
        <div class="section-paragraph">
            <p>
            I think FAC's strong focus on community and peer-based learning is something that I'm greatly interested in.
             I've seen how working with others who share a common goal and passion can create amazing results.
            Results I have experienced through running a society during university and also with participating in
             showcases within the dance community.
            </p>
            <p>
            Working with everyone at the Monday meetups, talking to cohort members and meeting alumni gave me a lot of
            motivation in learning how to code and further cemented the fact that I really want to be a part of the community.
            I want be able to give back and contribute to such an incredibly supportive, diverse and friendly environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The tech for better program is also very interesting because it gives people the chance to really use their 
            skills to make a difference. It would give me the opportunity to use tech to potentially create something meaningful
             on a much shorter timescale compared to research in academia and in clinical trials.
